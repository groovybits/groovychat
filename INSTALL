This will be much improved, and easier to do.

For now you can hopefully figure it out, basically 
you must change the cfg file to your liking and
place the cfg & cgi file in your cgi-bin.  


The chat.cfg and chat.cgi are the files that go in the cgi-bin.
the chatroom is accessable via /cgi-bin/chat.cgi.

You must setup the database by using the table.sql script with
a MySQL client.  The dbcreate perl program can create the table if
you create a database named CHATROOM ahead of time.  The username
and password of the user accessing the database is set in the tools.cfg
script. 

There are the default username and password in the chat.cfg and tools.cfg 
files.  These should be changed, never use the default ones, since then
anyone could attack your SQL server from remote if they try them.

The install script asks you where to put the chat program and will set the 
permissions secure, you must edit the configuratino file still which 
is chat.cfg.
